# LAB - 06

## Salmon Cookies

This app creates a homepage for a new buisness as well as a sales page for the owner to utilize for data tracking.  For now the focus is on creating objects for the sale page.

### Lab 07 Additions

Primarily worked on refactoring the code with constructors and using the DOM to create a table of data to replace the lists from the first lab.

Also added the first touches of CSS and structure to the homepage and sales page.

### Lab 08 Additions

Only finished the bare minimum for this assignment's completion.  Added some structure and images to the homepage and aligned some of the elements so that they aren't just all over the place.  It's still a pretty big mess though, so I'll be revisting it tomorrow.

### Reflections and Comments

**Lab 07**: It was easy enough to convert my object methods into functions that could perform in a constructor.  

The real time sink for me was figuring out how to tally up the hourly totals for the final row, and how to get the combined totals.

Messing with nested `for` loops still isn't my strongest skill.
